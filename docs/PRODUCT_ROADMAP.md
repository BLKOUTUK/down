### Phase 4: Growth (Sep-Nov 2026)

### Our Approach

**Community-powered:** Moderation, mediation, and event hosting as volunteer skills development, not platform overhead.

**Values-aligned partnerships:** Outsavvy for ticketing (not Stripe), keeping fees low and brand visible in LGBTQ+ spaces.

**Training before features:** The buddy system launches only after BLKOUTHUB course completion ensures cultural readiness.

**Focus over distraction:** One conversation at a time. Access windows create intentionality, not scarcity.

*Your feedback shapes this roadmap. What matters most to you?*
