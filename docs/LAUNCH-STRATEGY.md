## Phase Overview

| Phase | Dates | Focus | Users |

| **Marketing** | May 1-31 | Word of mouth campaign | Building buzz |
| **Launch** | June (pre-Pride) | Gala event + public launch | Open registration |

---

## February: Test Phase

### Black Meat Market Away Weekend (Feb 6-8)

**Goal**: Real-world test with friendly audience

**What we need**:
- Working profiles with photos
- Browse attendees
- Like/Match system
- Basic messaging
- Event page with schedule
- Icebreaker prompts

**What we're testing**:
- Core user flows
- Technical stability
- Feature gaps
- Community dynamics

### Post-Weekend (Feb 10-28)

**Activities**:
- Collect feedback (surveys, 1:1 conversations)
- Identify critical bugs
- Understand what's missing
- Document learnings

**Deliverable**: Test report with prioritized improvements

---

## March: Build Phase

### Iterate Based on Real Feedback

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1 | Bug fixes from BMM weekend |
| 2 | Top 3 user-requested features |
| 3 | Safety Check-In system |
| 4 | Mediation flow + Community agreements |

**No new features without user evidence**. Build what testers actually asked for.

---

## April: Soft Launch

### Invite-Only Release

**Who**:
- Partner organizations (UK Black Pride, GMFA, NAZ, etc.)
- Key community influencers (10-15 people)
- BMM testers who want to continue
- Hand-picked early adopters

**Target**: ~200 active users

**Goals**:
- Validate product-market fit
- Build core community culture
- Train community stewards for mediation
- Stress test at small scale

### Cohort Alpha Kickoff

- Community agreements vote
- Welcome event (virtual or in-person)
- Set the cultural tone before public launch

---

## May: Marketing Phase

### Slow-Burn Word of Mouth

**Strategy**: Let early users be the messengers

| Tactic | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Testimonials** | Video/written stories from soft launch users |
| **Partner promotion** | Partner orgs share with their communities |
| **Social teases** | "Something's coming for Pride..." |
| **Influencer posts** | Authentic endorsements, not ads |
| **Waitlist** | Build anticipation with registration |
| **Community events** | Pre-launch mixers (soft launch users + friends) |

**Not doing**:
- Paid ads
- Aggressive growth hacking
- Influencer sponsorships
- Mass email blasts

**Tone**: Exclusive, community-first, word spreading naturally

### Waitlist Building

## Resource Implications

| Jun | High | Launch push |

### What This Enables

- Proper testing with real users
- Time to respond to feedback
- No crunch or burnout
- Community culture established before scale
